## Installation & Setup

```powershell
# 1. Install dependencies
pip install -r .\jee_math_solver\requirements.txt

# 2. Set up Gemini API key
$env:GEMINI_API_KEY = "your_api_key_here"
```

## üíª CLI Usage

```powershell
# Basic problem solving
python -m jee_math_solver.cli "What is sin(30¬∞)?"

# Complex problems  
python -m jee_math_solver.cli "Solve x¬≤ + 5x + 6 = 0"
python -m jee_math_solver.cli "Find the derivative of sin(x)cos(x)"
```

### CLI Output Example
```
Solving: What is sin(30¬∞)?
==================================================

=== Final Answer ===
1/2

=== Mathematical Verification ===
‚úì Answer is mathematically valid
Simplified form: 1/2
Numerical value confirmed
Simple expression

=== Approach ===
1. Recognize 30¬∞ as a standard trigonometric angle
2. Recall exact value from unit circle: sin(30¬∞) = 1/2
3. Verify using 30-60-90 triangle ratios

=== Critical Thinking ===
Standard angle - should be memorized. Common mistake: 
using decimal 0.5 instead of exact fraction 1/2.
Related: cos(60¬∞) = 1/2, part of fundamental trig identities.

==================================================
Solution complete!
